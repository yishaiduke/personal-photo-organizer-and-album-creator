## Main Features
Features will be added soon


## Sample Code
```javascript
// Example code snippet for album component
import React from 'react';
import { Grid, Card, CardMedia, CardContent } from '@material-ui/core';

function Album() {
  return (
    <Grid container spacing={2}>
      <Grid item xs={4}>
        <Card>
          <CardMedia>
            <img src="photo-url" />
          </CardMedia>

## AI Coding Prompts

Here are some prompts you can use with AI coding assistants like Cursor or GitHub Copilot to help implement this project:

### Prompt 1
```
Create a new React component for displaying a photo album, using Material-UI's Grid and Card components to organize the layout. Start by creating a basic Grid container and adding a Card component with a media section for the photo and a content section for the title and description. Use Firebase to store the photo URL and album information, and integrate this data into the component.
```

### Prompt 2
```
Implement the core functionality for the album component, including the ability to upload and display multiple photos. Use Firebase's storage and database features to store and retrieve the photos, and update the component's state accordingly. Also, add event listeners for user interactions such as clicking on a photo to view its details.
```

### Prompt 3
```
Enhance the album component by adding advanced features such as photo filtering, sorting, and searching. Use Material-UI's filtering and sorting components to provide a seamless user experience, and integrate Firebase's real-time database to update the component in real-time as users interact with it.
```
